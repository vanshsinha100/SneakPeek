# Assets Information

This Nike landing page concept requires the following image assets to be placed in the `assets/` folder:

## Required Images:
1. `hero_shoe.png` - Main hero shoe image (should be a transparent PNG)
2. `card_shoe_1.png` - Nike Air Huarache thumbnail
3. `card_shoe_2.png` - Nike Air Max 270 thumbnail  
4. `card_shoe_3.png` - Nike Zoom Vomero thumbnail
5. `card_shoe_4.png` - Nike One Take thumbnail

## Image Specifications:
- All images should be high-quality PNG files with transparent backgrounds
- Hero shoe image should be large (recommended 800x600px or higher)
- Card shoe thumbnails can be smaller (recommended 200x200px)
- Images should show Nike shoes from a side angle for best visual effect

## Note:
The app will display placeholder text when images are not found, so you can run the app immediately to see the UI structure. Add the actual shoe images later to complete the visual design.

## Running the App:
```bash
flutter run
```

The app will work without the images - they'll show as placeholder containers with instructional text.
